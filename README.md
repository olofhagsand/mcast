This is mcast. A very simple traffic generator for UDP/IP uni and multi-cast.
for IP multicast, although it is useful for unicast too.

Mcast is under the GNU license, see the file COPYING, and is copyright
under its authors.  

Mcast is implemented by Olof Hagsand.

Mcast consists of two applications residing in one file each: 
	mcast.c - Traffic generator 
	mrcv.c  - Traffic receiver

The code is made to be as portable as possible. It should run on most
UNIXes, and used to run on Windows.
